# Neural Network Model Applicants

### What I'M Creating
To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, you will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables. You will do the following:

Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

Optimize the model.
